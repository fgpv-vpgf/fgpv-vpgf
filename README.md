# RAMP2

Demo site: http://ramp4-app.azureedge.net/legacy

This project is now a monorepo and contains the following repos under the `packages` folder:

- ramp-core (previously this repo)
- ramp-geoapi (previously https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/geoApi)
- ramp-geosearch (previously https://github.com/RAMP-PCAR/geosearch)
- ramp-plugin-areas-of-interest (previously at https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/plugins)
- ramp-plugin-back-to-cart (previously at https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/plugins)
- ramp-plugin-custom-export (previously at https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/plugins)
- ramp-plugin-coordinate-info (previously at https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/plugins)
- ramp-plugin-enhanced-table (previously at https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/plugins)

## Building the project

Install Python 2 if you don't already have it: [Python 2.7.18 Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/) (Python 3 is not supported)

Install the required C++ build tools (2 options)

- **OPTION 1 (recommended):** Install Visual Studio and the required additional package
  - [Walkthrough for complete Visual Studio installation and additional packages post-install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160)
  - [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019)
- **OPTION 2:** Directly add [windows-build-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools) package
  ```
  $ npm install --global windows-build-tools
  ```
  - **NOTE:** This may stop giving feedback in the console mid-install and seem to hang. However, it appears the required packages are still installed

Install Rush if you don't already have it:

```
$ npm install -g @microsoft/rush
```

Clone the repo and use Rush to install dependencies

```
$ rush update
```

You might want to run `rush update -p --full` to cleanly re-install all the dependencies (`-p` will purge what is currently there)

Build the project:

```
$ rush build
```

- **NOTE:** `rush build` will need to be run before the `rush serve` statement below any time code is changed in `ramp-geoapi` to avoid an outdated build

Serve the project:

```
$ rush serve -p 10 -v
```

- `-p 10` specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes to run (we need 8 right now to serve all the packages at the same time)
- `-v` provides verbose output for debugging

If you want to work on only a subset of packages instead you have to run their builds/serves seperately:

```
// terminal 0
$ cd packages/ramp-core
$ npm run serve

// terminal 1
$ cd packages/ramp-plugin-enhanced-table
$ npm run serve
```

Lastly open the samples page:

```
http://localhost:6001/samples/index-samples.html
etc.
```

## Documentation

The Reusable Accessible Mapping Platform (RAMP), also known as the Federal Geospatial Platform Visualiser (FGPV), is a Javascript based web mapping platform that provides a reusable, WCAG 2.0 AA compliant common viewer platform for the Government of Canada.

### Usage

#### Quick guide

We'll go through the simplest way to use RAMP, for more information see the [map author guide](http://fgpv-vpgf.github.io/fgpv-vpgf/master/#/mapauthor/intro)

First, grab the most recent release from the [github releases](https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/fgpv-vpgf/releases)
Place the files `rv-main.js` and `rv-styles.css` within your webpage's folder structure. We usually put our JavaScript files under a `js` folder and our stylesheets under a `css` folder.

Then you want to include those files on your page, along with jQuery and the needed polyfills (again, more info at the [map author guide](http://fgpv-vpgf.github.io/fgpv-vpgf/master/#/mapauthor/intro)):

1. Within `head`

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../rv-styles.css" />
```

2. Near the end of the `body`

```html
<script
  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"
  integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44="
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
<script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=default,Object.entries,Object.values,Array.prototype.find,Array.prototype.findIndex,Array.prototype.values,Array.prototype.includes,HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.toBlob,String.prototype.repeat,String.prototype.codePointAt,String.fromCodePoint,NodeList.prototype.@@iterator,Promise,Promise.prototype.finally"></script>
<script src="/js/rv-main.js"></script>
```

Now that you have the required files on your page we should add the map element.

```html
<div
  is="rv-map"
  style="height: 100%; display:flex;"
  rv-langs='["en-CA", "fr-CA"]'
></div>
```

A map should now load on your page. Theres much more you can do with RAMP, a good place to start (I'm mentioning it again!) is the [map author guide](#map-author-guide)
